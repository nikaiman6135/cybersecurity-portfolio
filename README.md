## 5. Project Experience

### Project 1: AI-Based Threat Hunter
* **Objective:** Create an intelligent system for real-time network threat identification.
* **Tools:** Python, Scapy, Gaussian Copula (GANs).
* **Outcome:** Successfully built a model capable of classifying complex network traffic patterns and detecting anomalies.

### Project 2: AI-Driven Vulnerability Prioritization
* **Objective:** Developing a framework for automated security scoring to prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.
* **Focus:** Integrating research from my UM Master’s program to enhance traditional VAPT workflows with AI-driven risk assessments.

## 6. Learning Journey
My path began with a strong academic foundation in network security, which I have since applied across SOC and VAPT roles in the banking sector. A major milestone in my journey has been transitioning from manual assessments to automated lifecycle management using enterprise tools like **ServiceNow**. While my networking background is robust, I am currently challenging myself with the **EC-Council CPENT** practice environment to master advanced exploit automation and bridge the gap between academic research and elite-level technical execution.

## 7. Career Objective
To leverage my experience in financial security and my research in AI to become a Lead Security Architect, focused on building automated, resilient defense frameworks for global enterprises.
